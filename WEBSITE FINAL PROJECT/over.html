          <h2><center><b>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">U.A. University is the #1 ranked high school for heroics and is considered as the top Hero University in Japan. Students are separated based on their abilities into specific Departments and Classes - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. Once a year, U.A. holds a tournament called the U.A. Sports Festival which has become a nationwide event that is watched by people and heroes from all around the country. Students from all departments are allowed to participate, and it is a chance for heroes in training to appeal to Pro Heroes for possible internships or recruitment. 

        It is also the opportunity for other students to gain admittance into the Hero Course, as well as for students from the Support and Business courses to promote their support items and products respectively, and further develop their business sense.
        U.A. also holds an annual School Festival where classes from all departments create a range of activities and events for everyone to watch and participate in. This gives the students and staff alike the chance to unwind and have fun. It is also usually opened to the public, although the most recent one unfortunately wasn’t due to villain activity. </p></b>

          <h2><center><b>Security System</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">At the entrance, there is a security wall nicknamed the "U.A. Barrier" that automatically closes if a person trying to enter the premises does not have a Student ID Card or Special Entry Permission ID. Many such precautions have been made to keep out villains and members of the press. 

        The U.A. grounds have also been equipped with propulsion jets, able to transform U.A. into a floating fortress. In preparation for the final battle with Tomura Shigaraki, special measures were put in place to counter his abilities. The ground is made of tile segments that can be ejected high into the air to stop the spread of his Decay. The tile segments can be replaced as they go. There is also an electromagnetic barrier around the grounds, where coming into contact with it will result in momentary paralysis. The whole thing is powered by several students with electrical Quirks. </p> </b>

          <h2><center><b>Uniforms</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">The U.A. High School student uniform consists of a long-sleeve, button-up white shirt, a gray jacket with blue-green stripes, and a red tie. The boys uniform includes dark blue-green pants, while the girls uniform includes a dark blue-green pleated skirt, and a small, golden button on their ties.

        Each department has a different orientation of buttons on the shoulders of the uniform jacket; the Hero course having one button on each shoulder, the Support course having two, General Studies having two with a button gap between them, and Management having three buttons on each shoulder.

        The U.A. P.E. uniform is a pair of dark blue pants with white vertical lines going up the legs and a dark blue short sleeve shirt with white lines that form the letters 'U' and 'A'. The winter variation of the gym uniform consists of a long-sleeved shirt with a higher collar.  </p> </b>
